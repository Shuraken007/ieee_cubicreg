(+) Generator Cost Data Format
      NOTE: If gen has ng rows, then the first ng rows of gencost contain
      the cost for active power produced by the corresponding generators.
      If gencost has 2*ng rows then rows ng+1 to 2*ng contain the reactive
      power costs in the same format.

          cost function, or number of data points for piecewise linear
